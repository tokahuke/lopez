# Contributing to this project

So you want to take a step further and contribute to this small project? Well,
you are in luck. Good help is always appreciated. I have a full time job and
also other ambitions that only let me tackle Lopez as a part time thing (it's 
more than mere "hooby"). Besides, your problems are yours, not mine. There is
no one better determined to solve your problems than _you_. However, not only 
drive, but also good coordination is necessary if we want to get anywhere at 
all, so here are the Rules of the Game©.

## Code of conduct

[Here](code-of-conduct.md) is a very standard code of conduct that GitHub gave
 me to paste in this repository. The gist of it is that trolls, harassers and
 spammers are not allowed and will be severely annoyed by me if they appear
 around here. Even though the ban hammer has never been so _in_ in the Web, I
 will try to err on the lenient side. This is your trigger warning.

## Don't start coding right away

Even if you are burning with the desire of putting just that three lines of code
in that file, don't start coding right away. Always open an issue first and let
_me_ greenlight your idea. The reason for this is twofold:
* I need to know where you are working so as not to make concurrent changes. I
have always found a pain to review merge conflicts.
* your idea might not be that great or there might be Another Way To Do It©.
Sorry. I have ideas which at first seem ingenious just to be dismantled in 10
secs by someone else almost every week. 
Well, if you really, _really_ feel confident, you may start coding before this
whole bureaucratic process. After all, the fork is yours. However, please know 
that I might be forced to reject your pull request.

If, for any reason, I take too long to answer your issue, you may fee free to
contact me by any other communication mens. I should be available on _some_
platform.

## Documentation

I expect that you also upgrade the wiki if your pull request makes some of that
information obsolete. Don't worry! I know my way around and can help you to
locate stuff. However, be warned that you are expected to write the docs of what
you contribute.

## Leaving your mark

Even though GitHub can make an excellent job of tracking contributors, I wish to
make this repository as independent from GitHub tech as possible. As such, you
may include your name in the [contributors file](./contributors.md) if you wish
in order to leave a permanent mark which is more up-front than git-blames.

You may leave a line using the following format:
```
Your Patronimic Full Name Junior III <your.email@address.com>: a short description 
of your heroic deeds.
```

You can contribute with one message per release. Under no circumstances a name 
is to be removed from this file.
